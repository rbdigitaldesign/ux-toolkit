  <h3>UX research: when and why to begin</h3>
  <p>
    UX research can—and should—be conducted at any point during the design process. It helps ensure that the work you’re doing is truly aligned with user needs, not just assumptions. Research activities vary across the project lifecycle, from discovery and exploration to validation and listening, and each stage offers methods that can improve product usability and experience.
  </p>
  <p>
    Farrell (2017) emphasises that it’s never too late to start, but the earlier the research, the greater its potential impact. Even when budgets are tight, combining a mix of early, ongoing, and lightweight research methods can yield valuable insights without overextending resources.

  <p>
    The most commonly used UX methods reported by practitioners include task analysis, usability testing, journey mapping, analytics review, and building personas. These approaches not only uncover usability issues, but also highlight opportunities for improvement in navigation, accessibility, and user satisfaction.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can tailor your approach depending on your product's stage and maturity. Whether you're validating an idea, refining an existing service, or gathering user sentiment, there’s a method fit for purpose. Think of UX research not as a checklist, but as an adaptable toolkit for creating better experiences.

    <h2>Usability testing</h2>
    <p>
      Usability testing involves observing users as they interact with a product to identify issues and opportunities for improvement. It can be conducted in two primary formats:
    </p>

    <div class="method-card right-image">
      <div class="method-text">
        <h3>Moderated testing</h3>
        <p>
          This approach involves observing users in real-time, usually over video calls using platforms like Zoom or Microsoft Teams. A facilitator guides the participant through tasks and asks follow-up questions to uncover usability issues and design improvement opportunities.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Live facilitation provides immediate insight into user struggles and behaviours.</li>
          <li>Useful for in-depth exploration of user thought processes.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Unmoderated testing</h3>
        <p>
          In this format, users complete tasks independently, typically through a browser-based testing platform such as Maze or Lookback. Sessions are recorded automatically and reviewed later for analysis.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Ideal for gathering feedback at scale and across diverse time zones.</li>
          <li>Less resource-intensive than moderated testing.</li>

        <h2>Card sorting</h2>
        <p>Card sorting helps understand how users categorise information, informing the design of intuitive navigation structures.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Open card sorting:</strong> Participants create their own categories.</li>
          <li><strong>Closed card sorting:</strong> Participants sort cards into predefined categories.</li>

    <section id="tree-testing" class="method-section">
      <div class="method-box">
        <h2>Tree testing</h2>
        <p>Tree testing evaluates the findability of topics in a website’s structure. Participants are given tasks to locate items within a simplified text version of the site hierarchy, helping identify navigation issues.</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!--–––– User interviews ––––-->
    <section id="interviews" class="method-section">
      <div class="method-box">
        <h2>User interviews</h2>
        <p>User interviews involve one-on-one sessions to gather in-depth insights into users’ experiences, motivations, and challenges. They can be structured, semi-structured, or unstructured, depending on the research goals.</p>

    <!--–––– Focus groups ––––-->
    <section id="focus-groups" class="method-section">
      <div class="method-box">
        <h2>Focus groups</h2>
        <p>Focus groups bring together a small group of users to discuss their experiences and perceptions. This method is useful for exploring shared attitudes and uncovering diverse viewpoints.</p>
